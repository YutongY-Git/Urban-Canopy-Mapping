# UTCC-Mapping
This is the pytorch codes for our paper:"Accounting for Shadows in Urban Canopy Coverage Mapping: A Hierarchical Spatial-Context Framework using Google Earth Imagery".This project provides a deep learning workflow for accurately estimating Urban Tree Canopy Coverage (UTCC) in high-density urban environments affected by complex shadow conditions. The proposed framework is designed to mitigate systematic underestimation of UTCC caused by building-cast shadows, especially dark shadows where spectral and visual information is severely degraded.Includes Google Earth imagery and annotated datasets, along with a configuration guide, sample data, and visualization scripts.
